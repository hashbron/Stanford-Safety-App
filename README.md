## Stanford Safety App
Imagine that you are a frosh going out on a Friday or Saturday night, an upperclassman in a dangerous situation, or just a student who wants to know their RA's number because they are locked out. We built an app that will connect you to resources that can support you and make you feel safer.

Stanford offers a wide range of services and resources to support students. While these resources are incredibly valuable, they are also dispersed across different places on campus, different online platforms, and sometimes require a lot of setup or planning. Instead of reinventing the wheel on many of these offerings from the university, our app gives students access to many of these desperate resources all in one place. Our cross-platform app makes it easy to sign up and connect with the people and resources that make you feel safe.
